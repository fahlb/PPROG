compile with "gcc -lm -o main main.c Runge_Kutta_4.c read_parameters.c ODEs.c"
main will create a data file with position and velocity of the bodies Saturn (0), Janus (1) and Epimetheus (2) over a time span of 10 years.

for resutls in terms of distance to center of mass as function of time compile results.c with "gcc -lm -o main main.c ODEs.c"
results will read the data file created by main and calculate the distance to the center of mass (cm) for each entrie. It then will write these results into a separate file.

soure/input.dat contains the initial conditions for the system and parameters for the integration.
